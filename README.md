# GrandMA2 API Documentation for Lua Scripting

## Introduction
Welcome to the comprehensive API documentation for Lua scripting in the GrandMA2 system. This serves as a go-to resource for Lighting Programmers looking to enhance their understanding and extend the capabilities of the GrandMA2 system. Explore detailed descriptions and basic syntax for all current GMA2 system functions.

## Description
This project aims to empower Lighting Programmers by providing comprehensive documentation for interacting with the GrandMA2 System using Lua scripting. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this documentation serves as a solid foundation for navigating and utilizing the capabilities of Lua in the GrandMA2 environment.

## Main Features
* **GMA2 Lua API:** A well-organized guide featuring each function's description, ensuring a clear understanding of the available features.
* **Modules:** Dedicated modules with detailed information on the basic syntax of functions in the Lua programming language, specifically designed for the GrandMA2 System.
* **Specialized Documents:** Documents for specific modules, such as a Default Variables guide for the gma.show.getvar() function in the gma.show module, and a Keycodes document for the gma.canbus.hardkey() function in the gma.canbus module.

## Future Updates
I hope to update this project with real-world examples using the above Lua functions. This update will provide Lighting Programmers with practical, real-world examples that allow for a quick start and easy iteration. 

## What is Lua?
Lua is a scripting language designed to support general procedural programming.
It offers support for object-oriented programming, functional programming, and data-driven programming. 
Lua is implemented as a library, written in clean C.

The GrandMA2 software currently supports Lua version 5.2.

For more information on scripting with Lua see: [Lua Docs](www.lua.org).
